# C++ Factorial Calculator

A beginner-friendly C++ program that computes the factorial of a given positive integer using an iterative loop.  
This project highlights input validation, loop-based calculations, and safe handling of large values using `unsigned long long`.

---

## Features
- Accepts user input for factorial calculation  
- Validates negative input values  
- Calculates factorial using a `for` loop  
- Supports large numbers via `unsigned long long`  

---

## Concepts Used
- Looping constructs  
- Input validation  
- Integer overflow considerations  
- Basic I/O operations  

---

## How to Run
1. Save the program as `main.cpp`  
2. Compile using:  
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o factorial
